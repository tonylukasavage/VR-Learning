# Learning with Unity + Oculus + Android

This project is just some of my initial tinkering with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), [Android](https://developer.android.com), and the [Gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/gear-vr) powered by [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/). The Android device in this case is my [Samsung Galaxy Note 7](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-note7/), but the Gear VR supports [more](http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/gear-vr/?cid=van-mb-cph-0716-10000089).

**DISCLAIMER:** Don't expect any warranty, support, or maintenance on this code.
